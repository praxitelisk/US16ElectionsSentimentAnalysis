#### This notebook will analyze tweets before US 16 Elections, on May 25 until May 27 2016. Tweets was initially fetched during that period with a python tweepy streamer and stored at a mongoDB.

#### This repo is a migration from Java to python, due to my effort to learn python.


#### This is an old project written back then in Java and now is transfered to python. The past results produced with Java can be found in this site [here](https://github.com/praxitelisk/us16-elections-sentiment-analysis-java)
